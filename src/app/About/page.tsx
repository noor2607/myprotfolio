                "In February 2023, I set out on an exciting path toooo become a web developer—a journey that’s been as challenging as it is rewarding. Driven by a curiosity to understand how the web works, I dove into learning programming languages, immersing myself in the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each day brought new discoveries, from understanding the logic of coding to seeing my ideas come to life on a webpage. As I built projects and expanded my skills, my passion for web development only grew stronger. This journey isn’t just about learning to code; it’s about mastering a craft that combines creativity and problem-solving, shaping me into a developer who’s ready to bring ideas to life online. And though there's much more to learn, I’m excited for every step ahead!"
